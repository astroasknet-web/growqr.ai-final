/**
 * Chat transcripts, and how they reach the CRM.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Before this module a qualified Lead's only Note read
 * "Intent: general_inquiry / Page: /" — no transcript, and not even the
 * conversation id, so there was no way back from the CRM record to the chat
 * that produced it. bot_events was not a substitute: it is an audit trail of
 * what the pipeline DID (ai_answered, handoff_requested…), it has no row at
 * all for a deterministic KB answer, and it never held the bot's reply text.
 *
 * WHY IDLENESS. SalesIQ's webhook bot calls us with handler = trigger |
 * message | context and nothing else — there is no end-of-chat handler, so
 * "the visitor is done" is never something we are told. Writing the Note per
 * turn would mean a Note per message; writing it on the first turn would mean
 * a transcript of one line. So a conversation is considered finished when it
 * has gone quiet for IDLE_MINUTES, and the flush runs from the CRM cron.
 *
 * (Zoho's own SalesIQ↔CRM integration would attach the real Chats related
 * list, transcript and visitor score — but only to records SalesIQ itself
 * created, and ours come in through the CRM API. That is portal
 * configuration, not code. This module is what makes the Lead useful whether
 * or not that link is ever switched on.)
