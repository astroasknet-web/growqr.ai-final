// Content-Security-Policy, shipped in REPORT-ONLY mode first (see the header
// below). Report-only never blocks a request — the browser only reports what a
// strict policy WOULD have blocked — so it cannot break Turnstile, Google
// Analytics, the Zoho SalesIQ chat, Supabase, or any page. Deploy, watch the
// browser console / any report endpoint in production (where the real widgets
// load), confirm the allow-lists are complete, then switch the header key to
// "Content-Security-Policy" to enforce.
//
// 'unsafe-inline' is present on script-src on purpose: enforcing via per-request
// nonces would force every page out of static generation into dynamic rendering
// (nonces can't be baked into a static page), which would regress this mostly
// static marketing site's performance. Keeping static rendering is the right
// trade-off here; the JSON-LD stored-XSS vector was already closed separately.
//
// Before flipping to enforcing, confirm against PRODUCTION report-only data:
//   - `'unsafe-eval'` violations seen in `next dev` come from React Refresh /
//     webpack HMR and do NOT occur in a production build — do not add it based
//     on dev noise; verify prod is clean.
//   - Widgets that only load with real keys (Turnstile, GA, Zoho SalesIQ) can
//     pull from origins not visible locally — watch prod reports for any host
//     to add (this is how api.iconify.design was found).
// The BlogForge engine origin (if configured) serves the analytics beacon
// (script), blog cover/inline images, and receives the beacon POST — so it must
// be allow-listed on script-src / img-src / connect-src. Empty when unset.
